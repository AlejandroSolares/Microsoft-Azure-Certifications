# Microsoft Azure Certifications
 This will be a repo with my personal expirience on the road to a full Cerfitified Azure Devops, this is by any means a real documentation for the certs mentioned inside, is just my own try and failure work-way 


## First steps

I'll use [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my scripts editors, for some exercises maybe ill use VS to creating some ARM templates, it goes to your own conffy editor or just use powershell/ISE to do all stuff i play with on this repo.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
